        id_prefix: >
          Set a prefix that will be used for all the names and emails of the
          enrolled students. (Quizard will automatically generate one for you
          if you leave this blank.)

      <p>
        Some recipes in Quizard require a pool of students to work with. This
        step allows you to "load", or prepare, that pool of students by loading
        them into the Quizard registry.
      </p>

      Loading __perPage__ students from page __page__.
    status_no_more_students: >
      Nothing to do, no more students to load.

  ns_take_quiz:
    unexpected_error: Something has gone wrong.
    response_generation_failed: >
      An error occurred trying to generate and prepare the student responses
      for submission. This is most likely an internal issue in Quizard and
      should be reported.

          Unable to register user with login "__login__".
          This probably means you have already registered a similar user by
          Quizard.
          <p>Try using a higher ID Range or a different ID Prefix.</p>

          Unable to enroll user with id __login__. Make sure the course
          allows self-operation!
