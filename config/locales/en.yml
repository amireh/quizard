      <p>
        Some recipes in Quizard require a pool of students to work with. This
        step allows you to "load", or prepare, that pool of students by loading
        them into the Quizard registry.

          This probably means you have already registered a similar user by
          Quizard.

          Unable to enroll user with id __login__. Make sure the course
          allows self-operation!
