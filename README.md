# Quizard

An in-house tool for use by developers of Canvas, the LMS by Instructure,
working on quizzes. Quizard provides automation for certain tasks that would
otherwise require a large effort to do by hand, like taking a quiz by a thousand
students.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/amireh/quizard/wiki) to get started.
